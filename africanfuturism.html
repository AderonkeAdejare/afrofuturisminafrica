        <h1> Origins</h1>

        <p> Inspired by the 1970s funk collective Parliament Funkadelic and the emergence of Afrofuturism through the internet in the '90s, African artists and writers wanted to participate in Afrofuturism.  However, their experiences as Black people living in Africa and their narratives differed drastically from the Black experience examined within Afrofuturism. </p>

        <br> <br>

        <p> In her 2018 essay  <a href="https://johannesburgreviewofbooks.com/2018/10/01/afrofuturism-is-not-for-africans-living-in-africa-an-essay-by-mohale-mashigo-excerpted-from-her-new-collection-of-short-stories-intruders/#:~:text=Afrofuturism%20is%20an%20escape%20for,a%20lot%20to%20many%20people." > <i> 'Afrofuturism: Ayashis’ Amateki'  </i></a>,
        South African writer Mohale Mashigo says there needs to be another word for Afrofuturism in Africa. She doesn't suggest what it should be but says <br>
        "May this ____________ (insert the name you’ve all agreed on) also focus on Now and not just The Future. Let us use our folktales if need be—use them to imagine us being fantastical in this Africa we occupy right now." </p>

            <p> <span> Africanfuturism </span>  is a sub-category of science fiction that "is specifically and more directly rooted in African culture, history, mythology and point-of view as it then branches into the Black Diaspora, and it does not privilege or center the West".
            Author Nnedi Okarafor formally defined it as such in her 2019 essay, "Africanfuturism Defined," as she felt the term "Afrofuturism" did not properly describe her work.
            You can read the full essay along with many Africanfuturist short stories in <a href="https://brittlepaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Africanfuturism-An-Anthology-edited-by-Wole-Talabi.pdf"><i>Africanfuturism: An Anthology</i></a>  (definition on page 9). </p>

            <p> <i> However, this was not the first use of this terminology. </i></p>
            <br>

            <p> Botswana-born visual artist, Phatsimo Sunstrum used the term "African Futurism,"  in her 2013 essay <a href="https://www.pamelaphatsimosunstrum.com/writing/afro-mythology-and-african-futurism-the-politics-of-imagining-and-methodologies-for-contemporary-creative-research-practices"> "Afro-Mythology and African Futurism", </a>
            to differentiate how Africans engage with speculative fiction versus Black people in the West. Okorafor emphasises that the term is one word in her definition so "the concepts of Africa and futurism cannot be seperated (or replaced with something else) because they both blend to create something new."</p>

        <p>Interactive digital media artist Dr. Tegan Bristow believes artists use African Futurism "to move past Western notions of a dystopian Africa"  and "as a critical take on the traditions and politics of a continent with a desperate need to encounter its contemporary self." </p>
        <br> <br>

        <p> Africanfuturism acknowledges the past of Africa - colonialism, the slave trade, etc. - but comes to terms with it and does not try to change it. Instead it focuses on "what is and can/will be" in Africa. Author Hope Abuke says Afrofuturism is still attached to the white Western gaze but
        Africanfuturism works to disclude the West - and the white gaze that comes from it - completely.
        Examples of Africanfuturism include Nnedi Okorafor's <i>Lagoon </i> and <i> The Rape of Shavi </i> by Buchi Emecheta. </p>

            <p class="lowerpg"> <span class="lowerhighlight"> Africanjujuism </span> is a subcategory of fantasy that "respectfully acknowledges the seamless blend of true existing African spiritualities and cosmologies with the imaginative", according to Okorafor.  Examples of Africanjujuism is

        <h1 class="lowerhighlight"> Note </h1>
        <p class="lowerpg"> Africanfuturism and Africanjujuism are not the same for every African. The way these genres are used varies on the creator's culture and their culture's past and present.
        This is especially important to note because Africa often gets mushed into a monolith when it is a continent with 54 different countries and hundreds of different ethnic groups. </p>
