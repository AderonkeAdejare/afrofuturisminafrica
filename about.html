<p> Aderonke would like to give a special shoutout to the people in her Afrofuturism class for riveting weekly discussions and making this class her favorite class of her first semester :). </p>

<br>

<p> Aderonke would also like to thank Roberta Dougherty, the subject librarian for African Studies at Yale University Library, for her assistance with research for this project. </p>
